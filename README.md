# Heroes-III (I only have screenshots of interfase because the repository is private and I'm not the owner of the repository.)
Group project (game was developed by 8 teams of 2-3 developers). 
My team was responsible for the economic part of the game (gui and logic). Project was created during the university subject - Zaawansowane programowanie w Java. 
It is a clone of Heroes 3. 
There are 2 players. At the beginning they buy creatures, artefacts, spells and skills and after that they fight. 
with the creatures/spells/skills/artifacts they bought. 
The main goal of this project was to understand that patterns and clean code are very important in programming and how to organize work between teams.
