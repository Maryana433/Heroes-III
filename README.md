# Heroes-III
Group project (game was developed by 8 groups of 2-3 programmers). 
My group was responsible for Economy part of game (gui and logic). 
Project was created during subject at the university - Zaawansowane programowanie w Java. 
It is a clone of Heroes3. 
There are 2 players, at the begining they buy creatures, artifacts, spells and skills and after that they fight 
using creature/spell/skills/artifacts they have bought. 
The main goal of this project was to understand that patterns and good code are very important in programming and how to organize 
work between teams.
